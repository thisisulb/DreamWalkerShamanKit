DREAMWALKER:
Dreamwalkers are Shamans with a strong divine connection to the Region of Dreams.

********************	
Dream Dust (replaces Writhing Fog):
(Conjuration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Summoning
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures a cloud of Dream Dust from the Region of Dreams. Any creature other than the caster that enters the cloud must save against spells or have its spirit pulled to the Region of Dreams for one round, effectively putting them asleep.
Creatures that remain in the cloud mast make a new save each round for the full duration of the spell. 
Elves have a very high chance to be unaffected by the effects of the cloud while Half-Elves will resist the effects one out of three times.

********************	
Nightmare Invocation (replaces Spiritual Clarity):
(Enchantment)

Level: 3
Sphere: Wards
Range: Long
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Spell negates

By casting this spell, the Dreamwalker channels a burst of energy from the Demiplane of Nightmare into a powerful psychic attack. Enemies within 30' that fail a save vs. spell at -4 perceive the caster as embodiment of their worst fear, causing them to flee in terror for 5 rounds. The borrowed nightmare energy however returns quickly to its source, pulling the Dreamwalker with it. On a failed save vs. spell at -4 the caster is pulled back deep into the Demiplane of Nightmare and rendered unconscious for 3 rounds. For every 4 extra levels of experience, the caster's save penalty is reduced by one, up to no penalty at level 16.~



********************	
Nightmare Imprisonment (replaces Spiritual Lock):
(Enchantment)

Level: 6
Sphere: Wards
Range: Long
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
Saving Throw: Special

When the Nightmare Imprisonment spell is cast on sleeping targets their spirits are pulled into and trapped on the Demiplane of Nightmare. Those who succeed on a save vs. death at -6 are able to eventually fight their way back, waking after 5 turns. Victims that fail their saving throw will quickly succumb to fear and madness or have their spirits torn asunder by the horrors that dwell there and are lost forever. 
While trapped in the Nightmare a victim's physical body remains asleep and can not wake under any circumstances.
