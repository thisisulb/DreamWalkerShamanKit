The borrowed nightmare energy however returns quickly to its source, pulling the Dreamwalker with it. On a failed save vs. spell at -4 the caster is pulled back deep into the Demiplane of Nightmare and rendered unconscious for 3 rounds.

While trapped in the Nightmare a victim's physical body remains asleep and can not wake under any circumstances.~
